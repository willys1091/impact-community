                                <p class="text-center">A devastating fire happened at the Avana On Main apartment
                                    complex by the MARTA Station in our neighborhood. Hundreds of our neighbors are now
                                    displaced and have lost everything they owned. We want to continue to be the hands
                                    and feet of Jesus and walk with them through this. Read more below about how you can
                                    help out.</p>

            <p>Right now, the best way to help is by providing gift cards to the families who’ve been displaced to local
                restaurants, grocery stores, Target, Walmart, etc. so they can replace the essential items they most
                need. If you’d like to provide gift cards, you can drop those off at our 515 location any day between 9a
                – 5p.

                You can also purchase an e-gift card and have it sent to firerelief@passioncitychurch.com and we will
                ensure it goes directly to the victims of the fire.</p>
